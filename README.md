# Cats and Dogs Breed AI Classifier
This project is part of my journey into machine learning and web deployment.
Throughout the process, I learned how to train and evaluate models using PyTorch, deploy a backend server on Hugging Face, and build a functional frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
